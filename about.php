            TaskÃ©mon was created by Sunny Gupta, Eric Wang, Tristan Ratchev, and Abhi Yarragunta as project during our time at the University of Florida.
            As students ourselves, we noticed how difficult it could be to stay focused and motivated while managing a growing list of responsibilities.
            <br><br>
            We wanted to build something fun, inspiring, and meaningful â€” not just for ourselves, but for anyone striving to stay on top of their tasks and goals. 
            TaskÃ©mon is our way of blending productivity with play, helping students and goal-chasers everywhere find joy in progress.
