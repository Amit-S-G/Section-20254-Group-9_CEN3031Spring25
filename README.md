# Hosting specifics
The web application will be hosted on a raspberry pi running the default raspberry pi OS.

It will be running on a LAMP stack (Raspberry Pi OS, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

For ease of access and development, we will utilize XAMPP (possibly ~ Helps with local hosting), with mySQL and phpmyadmin (to provide an easy web-interface for accessing the database).

Access to the server itself will be through SSH.
