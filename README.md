# Section-20254-Group-9_CEN3031Spring25

Created for UF's Introduction to Software Engineering Class. 

Group members are Sunny Gupta, Tristan Ratchev, Eric Wang, and Abhinav Yarragunta.

For ease of access and development, we will utilize XAMPP, with mySQL and phpmyadmin (to provide an easy web-interface for accessing the database).


# Project Details
This project is a task-checklist webapplication, allowing students to track their productivity and manage their time better, while also providing a fun way to do it through gamified elements.


# Hosting specifics
After completion, the web application will be hosted on a raspberry pi running headless raspberry pi OS.

It will be running on a LAMP stack (Raspberry Pi OS, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

Access to the server itself will be through SSH.
